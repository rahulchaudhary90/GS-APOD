# How this application works?

1) It's a Tab based application, 1st tab 'APOD list' & 2nd tab 'Favourite APOD list'.
2) In 1st tab all previously searched APOD will be listed with their date, title, explanation & image/videoThumbNail. We can add any APOD for specific date from top right '+' button. We can also make any APOD as 'favourite/unfavourite' by tapping on 'star' button. 
3) In 2nd tab all 'favourite' APOD will be listed with their date, title, explanation & image/videoThumbNail. From here we can also make any APOD as 'unfavourite' by tapping on 'star' button.
4) By tapping on any APOD cell in both tab, we will land on 'Preview screen', where image or video will be loaded for that APOD.
